    "# Decision Engine for Credit Card Approval\n",
    "This chapter explains the development of a custom deep learning model aimed at optimizing credit decisions for a financial institution. The primary objective of this model is to predict credit-related outcomes like approval status, credit limit, interest rate, and default risk. Furthermore, we aim to maximize profits while managing risks. This requires careful design of a custom loss function that balances profitability and credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Problem\n",
    "**Business Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The institution wants to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Approve credit for customers**: Decide which customers should receive credit.\n",
    "2. **Set credit limits**: Decide the maximum amount of credit for approved customers.\n",
    "3. **Assign interest rates**: Set a suitable interest rate based on the customer’s risk profile.\n",
    "4. **Predict default risks**: Estimate the probability that a customer might default on their credit.\n",
    "5. **Optimize profits**: Use the model to maximize profit by accurately predicting the right credit terms and avoiding high-risk customers.\n",
    "The institution profits by charging interest on approved credit, but it incurs losses when customers default on their payments. Therefore, optimizing profits requires balancing between generating interest (revenue) and avoiding defaults (costs).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data Simulation\n",
    "We created synthetic data to simulate customer behavior and credit-related factors. The dataset includes variables such as whether the customer was approved for credit, the credit limit they received, the interest rate applied, whether they defaulted, and the utilization rate (the proportion of the credit limit that the customer uses).\n",
