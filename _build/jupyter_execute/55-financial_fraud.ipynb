    "## 1. Introduction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Financial fraud encompasses a broad spectrum of illicit activities aimed at deceiving individuals, organizations, or institutions for financial gain. The proliferation of digital technologies, online banking, and e-commerce has significantly expanded the avenues through which fraudsters operate, making detection and prevention increasingly challenging. Effective fraud detection systems are critical for mitigating financial losses, maintaining stakeholder trust, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The dynamic and adaptive nature of financial fraud necessitates the continuous evolution of detection methodologies. Traditional rule-based systems are often insufficient in capturing the sophisticated and subtle patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. Consequently, the integration of advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has become indispensable in developing robust and scalable fraud detection frameworks.\r\n",
