# Machine Learning in Python

Welcome to *Machine Learning in Python*, a practical guide designed to help you explore machine learning concepts and techniques, all through Python. This book focuses on helping you learn by doing, using simulated datasets that closely resemble real-world data, so you can get hands-on experience without needing access to proprietary datasets. 

Think of this book as a learning tool — a way to get comfortable with machine learning workflows, practice coding, and understand the core algorithms. While it’s not exhaustive or the final word on machine learning, it’s built to give you a strong foundation that you can build on.

We’ll walk through everything from setting up your environment to running machine learning models in Python, all with a focus on practical application. Plus, you’ll find code snippets and explanations for each key concept, so you can easily follow along and experiment on your own.

## Setting Up Your Jupyter Book Environment

Before we dive into the fun stuff, let's set up your environment for running the Jupyter Book locally. Here’s how to get everything in place:

1. **Activate your Jupyter Book environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate jb
    ```

2. **Install Jupyter Book and dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -U jupyter-book
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-book
    ```

3. **Create and build your Jupyter Book:**
    Remember, you should not be inside the `mybookname` folder when running this:
    ```bash
    jb create mybookname
    jb build mybookname
    ```

4. **Push to GitHub Pages:**
    To publish your book, make sure you’re inside the `mybookname` folder:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mikenguyen13/mlpy
    cd mybookname
    pip install ghp-import
    ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html/
    ```

Once the book is built, it will automatically be published to GitHub Pages for easy access.
