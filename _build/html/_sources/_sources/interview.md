2. Try to keep a logical mind

Tricks: 
1. Common problems: FizzBuzz, Fibonacci sequence
2. It's okay to look at package or library docs

```
def fibonacci_of(n):
    if n in {0, 1}:  # Base case
        return n
    return fibonacci_of(n - 1) + fibonacci_of(n - 2)  # Recursive case


[fibonacci_of(n) for n in range(15)]
```
