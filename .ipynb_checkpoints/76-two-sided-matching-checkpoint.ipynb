    "# Two-Sided Matching & Ranking for Credit Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a high-level framework to build a two-sided matching system for credit cards, balancing your revenue (fees) and customers' utility (satisfaction). It also covers ranking multiple recommendations rather than suggesting just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understand the Two-Sided Nature of the Market\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supply Side (Banks & Cards)**  \n",
    "   - Each bank has multiple credit card products.  \n",
    "   - Attributes include:  \n",
    "     - APR or interest rate  \n",
    "     - Annual fee  \n",
    "     - Rewards structure (cashback, miles, points, etc.)  \n",
    "     - Sign-up bonus  \n",
    "     - Issuance constraints (e.g., min. credit score)  \n",
    "   - *Platform revenue:* Different cards/banks pay different referral commissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demand Side (Customers)**  \n",
    "   - Each customer has attributes like:  \n",
    "     - Credit score & income  \n",
    "     - Spending habits & preferences  \n",
    "   - They want a card that best suits their needs (max utility).  \n",
    "   - \"Hard constraints\": Must meet credit score, location, income requirements.  \n",
    "   - \"Soft preferences\": Type of rewards, brand preference, annual fee tolerance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key:** You need an approach that accounts for both sides: maximizing platform revenue (fees) and user satisfaction (utility).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overall Pipeline / Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filtering / Eligibility Check (Hard Constraints)**  \n",
    "   - Eliminate cards the customer cannot qualify for (score, income, location).\n",
    "2. **Utility Modeling (Soft Criteria)**  \n",
    "   - For each (customer, card) pair that survives the filter, compute a “user preference score.”  \n",
    "   - This can be done via heuristic (rule-based) or ML (learning-to-rank, collaborative filtering).\n",
    "3. **Revenue Modeling**  \n",
    "   - Estimate expected revenue per (customer, card):  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "       \\text{expected\\_revenue} = \\text{commission}(card) \\times P(\\text{approval}) \\times P(\\text{acceptance})\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "4. **Combine Utility & Revenue**  \n",
    "   - Use a weighted combination or multi-objective approach:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "       \\text{Final Score} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Utility} + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot \\text{Revenue}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "5. **Ranking & Output**  \n",
    "   - Rank feasible cards by final score and present top N suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Hard vs. Soft Criteria Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hard Criteria (Filters)**  \n",
    "  - Credit score thresholds, minimum income, region restrictions.  \n",
    "  - Any card failing these should be removed from consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soft Criteria (Preferences)**  \n",
    "  - Rewards type (cashback, points, miles).  \n",
    "  - Annual fee tolerance.  \n",
    "  - Brand preference.  \n",
    "  - Use a scoring formula or ML model to assess how well each card meets user’s preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data & Model Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data You Might Need\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Historical Interactions**  \n",
    "   - Which cards were shown to which users.  \n",
    "   - Which card they chose (if any), approval status, ongoing usage, etc.  \n",
    "2. **Card Metadata**  \n",
    "   - Commissions, APR, annual fees, reward structures.  \n",
    "3. **User Features**  \n",
    "   - Demographics, credit profile, stated preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Models to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Approval Probability Model**  \n",
    "   - Probability of being approved given user’s credit score, income, etc.  \n",
    "2. **Acceptance / Conversion Model**  \n",
    "   - Probability the user will actually apply if shown the card.  \n",
    "3. **User Satisfaction / Retention Model**  \n",
    "   - If data exists, predict how satisfied the user will be over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Multi-Objective Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weighted Sum Approach**  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "     \\text{Final Score} = \\alpha \\cdot U(\\text{user}, \\text{card}) \\;+\\; (1-\\alpha)\\times R(\\text{user}, \\text{card})\n",
    "   $$  \n",
    "   - Adjust $\\alpha$ via experiments (A/B tests).\n",
    "2. **Pareto Frontier**  \n",
    "   - More advanced. Finds non-dominated solutions in terms of user utility & revenue.\n",
    "3. **Constraint-Based**  \n",
    "   - E.g., “We want at least X user utility,” then maximize revenue (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Ranking Mechanism and Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top-K Ranking**  \n",
    "   - Sort the feasible cards by the final score and present the top N.  \n",
    "   - Optionally label them (“Best for Travel,” “No Annual Fee,” etc.) to help users.\n",
    "2. **Diversity / Exploration**  \n",
    "   - Consider a diversity factor if you don’t want all top recommendations from the same bank.\n",
    "3. **Explainability**  \n",
    "   - Show users why you’re recommending a certain card (higher approval chance, great rewards match, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Practical Steps to Start Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  \n",
    "   - Gather accurate card data (APR, fees, commissions) and user data (score, preferences).\n",
    "2. **Rule-Based Filter (Hard Constraints)**  \n",
    "   - Immediately remove cards that don’t meet basic eligibility.\n",
    "3. **Utility & Revenue Estimation**  \n",
    "   - `expected_revenue = commission * prob_approve * prob_accept`  \n",
    "   - `user_utility_score` can be a simple rule-based or an ML model.\n",
    "4. **Combine Scores**  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "     \\text{final\\_score} = \\alpha \\times \\text{user\\_utility\\_score} \\;+\\; (1-\\alpha)\\times \\text{expected\\_revenue}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "5. **Ranking & Display**  \n",
    "   - Sort by `final_score` and present the top options.\n",
    "6. **A/B Testing & Iteration**  \n",
    "   - Experiment with different $\\alpha$, different scoring methods, and measure outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Additional Nuances\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regulatory / Compliance**  \n",
    "  - Ensure no discrimination or violation of lending regulations.\n",
    "- **Bank Preferences**  \n",
    "  - If banks want specific types of customers, integrate their preference as another factor in your model or constraints.\n",
    "- **Cold Start Problems**  \n",
    "  - For new users/cards, rely on aggregate or attribute-based estimations until real interaction data is available.\n",
    "- **Online Learning / Bandit Approaches**  \n",
    "  - Advanced techniques to adapt in real time based on user responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter** out ineligible cards.  \n",
    "2. **Score** each candidate on both user utility and expected revenue.  \n",
    "3. **Combine** those scores via a multi-objective method.  \n",
    "4. **Rank** feasible cards and present top picks (not just one).  \n",
    "5. **Iterate** through A/B testing to optimize both user satisfaction and your revenue.\n",
